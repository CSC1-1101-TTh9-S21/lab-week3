# Starter code for week 3 lab, parts 1 and 2
# perimeter.py
# Prof. Prud'hommeaux

# Get some input from the user.
a=int(input("Enter the length of one side of the rectangle: "))
b=int(input("Enter the length of the other side of the rectangle: "))

# Print out the perimeter of the rectangle
c = a + a + b + b
print("The perimeter of your rectangle is: ", c)

# Part 1: Rewrite this code so that it gets the sides from
# command line arguments (i.e., Run... Customized)

# Part 2: Rewrite this code so that there are two functions:
# a function that calculates the perimeter
# a main function
