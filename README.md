# Lab exercises for week of February 8

### Part 1: Providing and accessing multiple command line arguments
Rewrite the code in `perimeter.py` to get the user input from command line arguments. 

### Part 2: Writing functions
Rewrite the code in `perimeter.py` so that there are two functions:
* a function called `calculate()` that calculates and prints out the perimeter, taking the two sides as arguments
* a main function that runs the `calculate()` function.

### Part 3: `if` statements
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer between 1 and 10, and then reports back whether it less than or more than 5.

### Part 4: `while` loop
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer bewteen 1 and 10. Multiply the number by 4 until it is greater than 50, reporting the value after each multiplication.

### Part 5: `for` loop
Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer. Then print out the word "snowman" that many times.

### Part 6: More functions
Do parts 3, 4, and 5, but using functions.
